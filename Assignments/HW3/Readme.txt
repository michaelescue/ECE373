Homework 3 Upload and Example Code
Posted Apr 27, 2019 9:08 PM

The homework has been updated. The only changes are in the deliverables. I have also uploaded two files to "example code." The first is the led_cleanup_script.sh which I showed you in class. This will require modification for it to work for you. The second is example_typescript.txt which has some information about what we will be looking for in a typescript at the top as well as an example of what a nice hw2 typescript would have looked like. Each assignment will have different requirements for what steps are shown but this should give you an example of what is expected in terms of readability.

Hopefully this clears up any confusion as to what is expected in homework submissions.
