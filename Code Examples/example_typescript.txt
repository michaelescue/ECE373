#NOTE: this typescript was generated by running a normal typescript and then, assuming the output
#is "typescript" the file was "cleaned up" using col as shown on the next line:
#col -bp < typescript > example_typescript.txt
#even though this output is not perfect, it is clean enough to read. If you have lines which are really long (>200 characters)
#please try to clean up some of the extra garbage characters so that it is READABLE. However, it does not need to be perfect
#as we are primarily interested in the commands that you ran and the output.
#notice that for commands which generate a lot of output (dmesg, ls, etc...) you can pipe the output into programs like
#head, tail, grep, cut, etc to make it more reasonable to read. In general, all PERTINENT information should be EASILY readable
#and all other information should be NOT TERRIBLE to read.
